Welcome to Algorithmic, LLC. We are a small consulting group offering expertise in high-performance declarative analytics. We specialize in scaling logic-defined solutions to challenging problems in static analysis, graph mining, and security. 

Together, we have built leading-edge Datalog engines that run on the highest-performance hardware currently available. We have scaled transitive closure up to 32k cores of a supercomputer, and whole-program analysis of the Linux kernel on the H100 GPU. We have led the development of the fastest-available Datalog engines on servers, GPUs, and supercomputing clusters.

We are:

- Thomas Gilray, Washington State University
- Sidharth Kumar, University of Illinois at Chicago
- Kristopher Micinski, Syracuse University
